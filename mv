mv (short for move)
A unix command that moves one or more files or directories from one place to another.

Since it can 'move' files from one filename to another, it can also be used to rename files.

Examples:
mv myfile mynewfilename           # renames 'myfile' to 'mynewfilename'
mv myfile ~/myfiles               # moves 'myfile' from the current directory to user's home directory
mv myfile subdir                  # moves 'myfile' to subdir/myfile relative to the current directory.

mv !(bkup|bkup2) bkup2            # move all the files and directories (except bkup1, bkup2) to the 'bkup2' directory.

mv be.03 /mnt/bkup/bes            # copies 'be.03' to the mounted volume 'bkup' the 'bes' directory, 
                                  # then 'be.03' is removed.
