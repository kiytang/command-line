Word Count

wc can read for either standard input or a list of files and generates one of the following statistics:

1/  newline
2/  word count

If we want a more specific return result, we can use the folowing switches:

-l    print the line count 
-c    print the byte count
-m    print the character count
-L    print length of the longest line
-w    print the word count
