The ps command: source http://www.linfo.org/ps.html

'ps' stands for process status-

is used to provide information about the currently running processes, including their process identification numbers (PIDs)

A process, also referred to as a task, is a running instance of a program.

Basic syntax of ps is

ps [options]

when ps is used without options, it sends to standard output, which is the display monitor by default, four items of informatio
for at least 2 processes currently on the syste,:

1/  the shell
2/  ps

A shell is a program that provides the traditional,text-only iser interface for issueing commands and interacting with the
system, and is bash by default on Linux.

The 4 items are labeled:

PID:  Process Identification Number

TTY:  terminal type is the name of the console/terminal (i.e., combination of monitor and keyboard) that the user logged into.

TIME  the amount of CPU time in min and sec that the process has been running

CMD   the name of the command that launced the process

Common ways to use ps:

to obtain much more complete information about the processes currently on the system:

ps -aux | less

**
-a option tells ps to list the processes of all users on the system rather than just those of the current user

-u option tells ps toprovide detailed info. about each process

-x option adds to the list process that have no controlling terminal, such as daemons, which are programs that are launched
   during booting and run unobtrusively in the background until they are activated by a particular event or condition
